  <h1 align="Center">HTTP API Calls</h1>
</p>

## Description

This capsule demonstrates how to use Bixby's HTTP library to make API calls

## Usage - HTTP API Calls

To see Bixby http api calls in action, open in the simulator and run

`Find Shoes` - simple HTTP get call

`Find formal shoes` - HTTP get call with parameter]

`Find shoes and show headers` - HTTP get call - logs will show headers

`Find shoes error` - HTTP get call that returns an error

`Create shoe` - HTTP post call

`Find shoes with remote endpoint` - Using a remote endpoint for the HTTP get call

The code that makes the API calls is in `/code` - note that you do not need to use a promise or call back, the Bixby HTTP library takes care of that for you.

#### Tutorial Video on HTTP calls

If you want to see the contents of the endpoint this capsule uses (at https://my-json-server.typicode.com/bixbydevelopers/capsule-samples-collection/), but cannot access the link, you can view the data in endpointContents.zip. You can also see the data the endpoint returned in the Debug Console, if you click on the action (i.e. FindShoe), then click on 'requests'.
