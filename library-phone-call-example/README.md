<h1 align="Center">Phone Call Example</h1>
</p>

## Description

This capsule demonstrates how to use the Phone Call (`bixby.phoneCall`) library in a Bixby capsule.

`bixby.phoneCall` allows a capsule to call a phone number. For more information, see the docs for [`bixby.phoneCall`](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/library.phonecall)

## Usage

To test this, open the simulator and run:

`Start`

You can either tap on the cell-card or say `Call this business`

To properly test this, you'll need to do on-device testing. You may edit the phone number in `FindBusiness.js` as appropriate
