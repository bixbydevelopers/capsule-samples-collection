One thing to note about the bixby.textMessage library capsule, if you don't have a phone number, it won't work. Whether you grab the number from some type of business search or contact search is up to you. For most sharing needs, use Share Via instead.

Here is an example implementation for the bixby.phoneCall library capsule.

To test this, open the simulator and run:

`Start`

You can either tap on the cell-card or run `send feedback`

To properly test it, you'll need to do on-device testing.
