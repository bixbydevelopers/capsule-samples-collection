<h1 align="Center">Share Via Example</h1>
</p>
## Description

This capsule demonstrates how to use the ShareVia () library in a Bixby capsule.

`viv.shareVia` allows a capsule to use the Android share functionality. For more information, see the docs for [`viv.shareVia`](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/library.sharevia)

## Usage

To test this, open the simulator and run:

`Start`

Click on a video. Then run `Share` or click on the "Share this video" cell-card.

To properly test this, you'll need to do on-device testing.
