<h1 align="Center">Text Message Example</h1>
</p>

## Description

This capsule demonstrates how to use the textMessage (`bixby.textMessage`) library in a Bixby capsule.

`bixby.textMessage` allows a capsule to send an SMS text message. For more information, see the docs for [bixby.testMessage](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/dev-guide/developers/library.textmessage)

Note: `bixby.textMessage` is designed to send a message to a particular phone number. If you want to allow users to share things, such as an image or video, you should instead use `viv.shareVia`, which allows users to choose an app and recipient when sharing.

## Usage

To test this, open the simulator and run:

`Start`

You can either tap on one of the cell-cards or say `Send feeback`

To properly test this, change the phone number in `FindBusiness.js` to a real number and use on-device testing
