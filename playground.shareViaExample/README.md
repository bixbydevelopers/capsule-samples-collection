Here is an example of how to implement the Share Via library capsule. Share via is useful for allowing the user to share something from your capsule with people that they know.

Start this capsule by opening the simulator and running:

`Start`

Click on a video. Then run `Share` or click on the "Share this video" cell-card.

To properly test it, you'll need to do on-device testing.
